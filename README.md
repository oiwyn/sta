# Smarter Travel Assitant
This is a preview/mockup of a travel agency website that was made during my second university year at James Cook University (2014).

All the back-end codes/pages which allow registering and logging in to the website made for this website are still hosted on the university's web server which you can still access on:

# Background
Our professor of this subject assigned us to create a travel agency website based in Singapore, with the whole class divided by groups, and each group consisted of three (3) people.

My work consisted of; designing graphics for the website, CSS, HTML, and PHP programming. One of my friend took care of the database (backend) part of the website, and the other one was tasked for content, and documentation creation of the website.

This repo only consists the front-end part of the website, and will not be updated further. 
I'm placing it here just for nostalgia's sake.

# Notes
This will be my playground on getting myself familiar with GitHub, polish my skills further, and train myself to adapt to the needs of the my client faster, better, and more efficient.
