# Smarter Travel Assitant
This is a preview of a travel agency website that was made during my second university year, 2014.

All the back-end codes/pages which allows register, logging in to the website made for this website are still hosted on our students' web server which you can still access on:

# Background
The lecturer of this subject assigned us to create a Singapore travel agency website, with the whole class divided by groups, and a group consists of three (3) people.

My work consisted of; designing graphics for the website, CSS, HTML, and PHP programming. One of my friend took care of the database (backend) part of the website, and the other one prepared for content, and documentation of the website.

Right now, this repo only consists of the front-end part of the website, and will not be updated further. 
I'm placing it here for nostalgia sake.

# Notes
This will be my playground on getting myself familiar with GitHub, polish my skills further, and train myself to adapt to the needs of the my client faster, better, and more efficient.
